## 👋 Hi, I'm Nagendra Jonnarapu!

🌟 Passionate about building clean, responsive web interfaces and turning ideas into reality through code.

📘 Currently improving my skills in **Full-Stack Web Development**, with hands-on experience in  
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, SQL**, and exploring **Java Backend Development**.

🔍 I enjoy learning new technologies, working on real-world projects, and continuously improving my craft.

🐞 I genuinely love solving bugs more than creating them — refining code and optimizing performance motivates me.
